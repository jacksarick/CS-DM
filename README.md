#CS and DM
<h1>Hello, world</h1>
Most of the code we use in the Computer Science & Digital Media Club at UCC
More will be added as needed/as I make it
<h2>Things to note</h2>
I try to upload a couple different ways to do everything in at least Python. Emphasis on try. If you have other ways, or other languages, feel free to contribute.
The "DIRTY" notation on file names means it is not a very clean solution.
The titles are overly descriptive. If you have a problem with this, keep it to yourself.

I do this out of love for al things binary. Like it? Please tell me! Don't like it? Help out!
